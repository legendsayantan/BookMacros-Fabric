# BookMacros-Fabric
A fabric mod to use Books and Lecterns as client-side macros for chat and commands.

## How to use
Write the chat messages or commands in a book, one in each page. After the book is saved, whenever you open a page in your hand or in a lectern, you will get option to **Copy the page to chat** or **Send it to chat**.

If you write commands in the book, **Send to Chat** will execute the commands.
